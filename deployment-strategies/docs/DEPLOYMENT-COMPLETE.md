### **1. Quick Setup (2 minutes)**
```bash
cd sophisticated-release-patterns

# Setup infrastructure and make scripts executable
./sophisticated-release-patterns.sh setup

# Verify installation
./sophisticated-release-patterns.sh status
```

### **2. Your First Deployment (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Try blue-green deployment
./sophisticated-release-patterns.sh blue-green api-gateway v1.2.0

# Try canary deployment with feature flags

```

### **3. Feature Flags Management**
```bash
# Create and manage feature flags
./feature-flags/feature-flags-manager.sh create "newFeature" "Amazing new feature" false 0

# Gradual rollout
./feature-flags/feature-flags-manager.sh rollout "newFeature" 100 10 60

# A/B testing
./feature-flags/feature-flags-manager.sh ab-test "newFeature" 25 25 3600
```

### **4. Monitoring and Rollback**
```bash
# Monitor with automatic rollback
./rollback-automation.sh monitor api-gateway blue-green 600

# Emergency procedures
./rollback-automation.sh rollback-system "Critical issue detected"
./feature-flags/feature-flags-manager.sh emergency
```
